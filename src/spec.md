# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable real-time vehicle location updates and enhance the train schedule display with comprehensive information and filtering.

**Planned changes:**
- Add backend function `addOrUpdateVehicleLocation` to accept and store vehicle GPS coordinates and timestamps
- Connect frontend to call the location update function and enable periodic updates for vehicle tracking
- Enhance train schedule display with detailed timing, route information, filtering capabilities, and improved visual layout

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see vehicles moving in real-time on the transport map, and access a comprehensive, filterable train schedule with detailed departure/arrival times and route information.

  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive GPS vehicle tracking functionality across backend and frontend. The backend adds a Vehicle type with all required fields (id, name, latitude, longitude, vehicleType, timestamp) and a getVehicleLocations query. The frontend adds useGetAllVehicleLocations hook with 5-second refetch intervals and proper error handling. TransportMap.tsx implements complete marker management with add/update/remove logic, smooth position transitions, and prevents duplicates. All four requirements (REQ-34, REQ-35, REQ-36, REQ-37) are fully addressed with evidence in the code.",
